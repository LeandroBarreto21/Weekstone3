           but was best known for playing in Real Madrid because of his great skills, 
           the reason that Ronaldo Nazario is called R9 because when he played 
           in Real Madrid his jersey number was 9,
        and in the image above it shows Ronaldo holding the World Cup trophy 
        in 2002, by the way the World Cup is a world wide tournament
        that is held every 4 years, so this is a very competetive tournament.

    <p>Francisco Guillermo Ochoa Magaña, also known by his nickname Memo is a proffesional Mexican soccer player 
        who played as a goalkeeper who currently plays for Serie A club Salernitana an Italian club, and is 
        a captain for the Mexican national team, he was known for Club America a Mexican club, but well known 
        in Mexico national team, and in Club America he was the first-choice keeper up  until 2011, he was 
        transferred in some clubs but came back to Club America in 2019, in the picture above you can see that he is 
        holding the Gold cup trophy and the Golden Glove trophy, so the Gold Cup is a tournament
        that is held every 2 years and only countries in North America can participate in the 
        tournament, and the Golden Glove trophy is an award that is awarded to the best goalkeeper during the 
        Gold Cup, and he inspired me to play soccer because of the great saves he made during his career, which made 
        me think that one day I can be good as him, but there is another goalkeeper that inpired me as well, 
        and his name is Jorge Campos a former soccer player and the reason he inspires me because 
        he plays very well even though he is one of the shortest goalkeeper in soccer and many managers want a tall goalkeeper,
        because tall goalkeeper are usually better goalkeepers, but Jorge Campos proved them wrong and was awarded with the 
        Bronze for the third Best goalkeeper awarded by the IFFHS in 1993, and he teached me that no matter how tall you are, 
        you can be good at being goalkeeper and there is an image of him below.
